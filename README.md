# Bunny Feeder

## A game for bunny lovers and alike

### What will the application do?

<em>Finally</em>, a game to satisfy the love for bunnies! This application will (hopefully) render a cute bunny at the 
bottom of the graphic interface, which the lucky user will then have to feed. Carrots will be raining down from the top 
(every bunny's wildest dream), and the user controls a sort of catcher, like a basket, to collect the carrots. Each 
carrot will add 10 points to the bunny's hunger satiety scale (out of 100), and after that, he will be too stuffed to 
eat more. After that point, the poor bunny will pass out and the game is over. 

### Who will use it?

Bunny Feeder welcomes **any and all** of the following people to play:
- bunny lovers
- non-bunny lovers
- <em>even bunny-neutral persons</em>
- ...it's for everybunny!

### Why is this project of interest to you? 

On a personal level, I wanted to do something bunny-related because I was once the servant to 2 adorable bunny sisters. 
They shared the same fur pattern, but had opposite colors. They would be running after each other over stealing the 
other's treats, then cuddling each other the next second. Then, when they're pooped out from eating so much, they would 
flop over on their side and nap (if you don't know what a **bunny flop** is, check it out 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2VwpaFxJrQ) - I promise no Rick Rolling). Unfortunately, I had to give them up 
(no Rick Rolling intended) over to a fellow bunny lover friend, but I still think about them constantly. This game is 
dedicated to my bunnies who loved carrots.
